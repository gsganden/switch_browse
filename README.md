# Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Mapper

A simple utility to map Nintendo Switch Pro Controller inputs to keyboard commands and mouse scrolling. I use it as a more ergonomic way to read through documents and emails that don't require much typing.

## Controls

### D-Pad
- Up: Up Arrow
- Down: Down Arrow
- Right: Page Up
- Left: Page Down

### Face Buttons
- A: J (i.e. next email with GMail keyboard shortcuts enabled)
- B: E (i.e. archive email with GMail keyboard shortcuts enabled)

### Joysticks
- Left Stick Up/Down: Mouse scroll (pushing up scrolls up, pushing down scrolls down)
